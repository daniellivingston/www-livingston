## Hi, I’m Daniel.

I'm a software engineer interested in computational geometry (like polygonal meshing, 3D graphics, and augmented reality), geospatial analysis (usually within GIS frameworks), parallel programming (including distributed and high-performance computing), and, most importantly, ways of coupling those domains together.

At Los Alamos National Laboratory, I work in the Computational Earth Science group on quite a few projects related to this. Public-facing projects I lead or am a core member of include [TINerator](https://github.com/lanl/tinerator), [VORONOI](https://github.com/lanl/voronoi), [LaGriT](https://github.com/lanl/LaGriT), [dfnWorks](https://dfnworks.lanl.gov), and [Amanzi-ATS](https://amanzi.github.io).

In my free time, I'm an [avid CrossFitter](https://www.facebook.com/CrossFitLosAlamos/), play [classical and folk guitar](https://youtu.be/o6i4NIxGx50), study for a [M.Sc. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu), and enjoy a good beer or two from the [local brewery co-op](https://www.bathtubrowbrewing.coop).
