## Hi, I’m Daniel.

I’m currently an R&D Software Engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I work on algorithm development for 3D mesh generation and manipulation for finite element multi-physics codes. I also do algorithm development for GIS data manipulation and analysis, and work on 2D/3D visualization techniques, especially but not exclusively with Matplotlib and VTK.

Some of my projects of note include:

- **TINerator**, a Python module which allows for advanced surface and volumetric meshing from GIS data sources like Digital Elevation Maps, soil maps, and shapefiles.
- **VORONOI**, an “embarrassingly parallel” Fortran90 code for Voronoi tessellation generation from triangulated surface or tetrahedralized volume meshes.
- **MacroRX**, a CLI and iOS/macOS application which leverages the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to auto-generate meal plans to fit fitness goals.

In my spare time, I like doing functional fitness training, which recently has taken the form of CrossFit workouts. I’ve played guitar for the better part of two decades, with a big focus on 1960s and ‘70s folk and rock music (particularly Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Pink Floyd), and Spanish classical guitar, like Francisco Tárrega. I’ve also taken a deep interest in retro video game programming, specifically for the Gameboy Color, as a proxy for learning systems programming.
