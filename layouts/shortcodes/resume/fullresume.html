						    <p>• Lead developer and co-project lead on TINerator, a Python module for complex mesh generation from GIS data for finite-element multi-physics codes. Incorporates Digital Elevation Maps, soil maps, watershed delineation, and more. Used across U.S. national laboratories including LANL, PNNL,  and LBNL.

						• Lead the development of VORONOI, an open source Fortran90-based program leveraging PETSc and MPI to quickly generate Voronoi tessellations from million+ node Delaunay meshes into subsurface flow and transport formats (like PFLOTRAN, TOUGH2, and FEHM).

						• Core team member of LaGriT, a library and program for complex structured and unstructured mesh generation. FORTRAN77, C++, and C99.

						• Algorithm development in Julia for statistical firespread over some topography, given surface datasets like fuel moisture and elevation maps.

						• Novel 3D visualization techniques, including live rendering of 3D objects within Jupyter notebooks. VTK, VTK.js, WebGL.

						• Physics-informed machine learning algorithm development.</p>
